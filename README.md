## Vim Experiments

An exploration of the capabilities and limitations of Vim's embedded Ruby. An accompaniment for the talk I'm giving at [VimLondon](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/) on March 26th.

I think it's more interesting to understand how I figured things out, rather than what was actually discovered. Therefore, I've tried to include lots of comments and outline a logical order for my thought process.

If you're passionate about Vim, or you're carrying out some crazy experiments of your own, you should follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/cpatuzzo).
