## Vim Experiments

An exploration of the capabilities and limitations of Vim's embedded Ruby. An accompaniment for the talk I'm giving at [VimLondon](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/) on March 26th.

I think it's more interesting to understand how I figured things out, rather than what was actually discovered. Therefore, I've tried to include lots of comments and outline a logical order for my thought process.

## Prerequisites

For the later examples, you'll need a version of Vim compiled with +ruby support, and the relevant gems, where applicable. You can test your Ruby version by running `:ruby print RUBY_DESCRIPTION` inside Vim.

## Code Quality

Most experiments were created in a single pass. They are for proof-of-concept only.
